# Synthetic_Data_Object_Detection
Creating Labeled Synthetic Image Data using Unity Perception, then training an Object Detection model using the synthetic data and retraining on real images. (Dinner fork)

Steps:
1. Created 400,000+ images using Unity Perception and a 3d model of a fork
2. Took ~800 real images of a fork
3. Trained a computer vision model using the 400,000 synthetic images
4. Fine-tuned the model on the real images
